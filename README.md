## Description

This app can be used to help users keep track of their finances. When a user inputs an amount of money they will be given a visual representation of their spending habits. That way they can spend their money accordingly. In addition the app also works as a PWA so the user can dowload the app on their phone and use it without a connection to the internet. This can make the app ideal for when traveling abroad.
